# 🌍 Code vs Tectonics

> **A dashboard exploring the spurious correlation between software development velocity and global seismic activity.**

Do AWS SDK commits trigger earthquakes? Probably not. But the data looks cool.

## ⚡ Features

  * **Live Data Correlation:** Overlays real-time GitHub commit history against USGS Earthquake data.
  * **Dynamic Repo Selector:** Compare tectonic shifts against `aws/aws-sdk-js`, `facebook/react`, or any custom public repository.
  * **The "Chaos Ratio":** Calculates a pseudo-scientific synchronization score between code pushes and tectonic plate movements.
  * **Gruvbox Aesthetic:** A retro, eye-friendly, gradient-free design system.
  * **Zero-Dependency Charts:** Custom SVG visualizations built from scratch (no Chart.js/Recharts).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

  * **Framework:** React (Vite)

  * **Icons:** Lucide React
  * **Utilities:** date-fns
